# OnJuno Assignment

This demo has been built using Tailwind and is responsive in nature. The Vuex store has been used to demonstrate how the dropdown can be toggled globally. This behavior can be applyed to modals, menu drawers and other such components.

You can click on the links in the dropdown menu to navigate between different pages and to go back to the home page you can click on the placeholder logo.

The demo for this has been hosted on [HEROKU](https://onjuno-assignment.herokuapp.com/).
